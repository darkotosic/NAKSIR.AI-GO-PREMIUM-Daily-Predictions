# CHG-017 – Add frontend type-check to CI

## Why
- CI currently validates backend checks but skips frontend TypeScript typing.
- Adding a dedicated type-check keeps the workflow aligned with the repo's current frontend scope.

## Impacted Micro-cells
- CELL_FRONTEND_APP
- CELL_INFRA_GOVERNANCE

## Contract Changes
- Before: CI did not run frontend TypeScript type-check.
- After: CI runs `npm ci` and `npm run typecheck` in `frontend/`.

## Migration Plan
- Merge the workflow update; CI will install frontend dependencies and run the type-check on push/pull.

## Rollback Plan
- Revert the CI workflow step and the `typecheck` script entry if needed.
