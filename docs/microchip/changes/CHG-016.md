# CHG-016 – Premium SKU whitelist + ads/AI gating

## Why
- Simplify the SKU catalog to three Premium plans and hard-block anything else.
- Ensure Premium users get a clean, ad-free experience and unlimited AI access.
- Keep frontend, shared contracts, and backend in sync for entitlements.

## Impacted Micro-cells
- CELL_FRONTEND_APP
- CELL_BACKEND_API
- CELL_BACKEND_DATA
- CELL_SHARED_BILLING

## Contract Changes
- Before:
  - Multiple day-based SKUs (1/7/30) with limited allowances.
  - AI cache hits were not paywalled for free users on POST.
- After:
  - Only `naksir_premium_7d`, `naksir_premium_1m`, `naksir_premium_1y` are accepted.
  - Premium gets unlimited AI; free users require rewarded unlock and cache hits are paywalled.

## Migration Plan
- Deploy backend SKU whitelist and AI enforcement changes first.
- Update shared contracts and release the frontend with new SKU list and Premium UI.
- Confirm store SKUs match the whitelist.

## Rollback Plan
- Revert backend and frontend changes to restore previous SKU list and ad/AI behavior.
- Re-release frontend build if needed.
