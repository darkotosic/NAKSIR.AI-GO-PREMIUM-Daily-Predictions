# CHG-015 – Live AI eligibility + 15-minute snapshot cache

## Why
- Limit live AI generation to top leagues/UEFA and reduce duplicate generations by caching per 15-minute bucket.

## Impacted Micro-cells
- CELL_BACKEND_FETCH_CACHE
- CELL_BACKEND_API
- CELL_BACKEND_DATA

## Contract Changes
- Before: Live AI could be generated for any league and live requests did not return an explicit unavailable payload.
- After: Live AI returns an unavailable payload for non-top/UEFA leagues; live responses are cached per 15-minute bucket.

## Migration Plan
- Deploy backend changes.
- Monitor live AI responses and cache utilization in logs.

## Rollback Plan
- Revert the change set and redeploy the prior backend build.
